#Discussitnowonline 

A website for posting papers, pictures, research, whatever you want and then discussing it.

Visit the website here: http://discussitnowonline.appspot.com/

###Description

This website was built as a final project for a mobile app and website development class at The University of Texas at Austin. I designed and created the website myself. The idea is that if you have anything you want to talk about upload a picture of it and anyone can comment on it or argue about it. 

###Navigating Around

There are 5 different pages in the website.

1. Manage My Account
	This page shows all documents that you have uploaded or are following, as well as, statistics all statistics about your document. One can also delete documents from here.
2. View A Document
	This page lets one view the document and it allows one to add comments and errors that a person sees in it. These comments can be placed anywhere on the document. The comments can be up or down voted and can be commented on as well. They can also be deleted if one want to.

	Self explanatory.
4. Create a document
	One must pick the author and title of the document and then can upload as many pictures as they want.
5. Search For A Document
